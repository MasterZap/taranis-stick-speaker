# Tarnis Stick Position Speaker Script

This is a LUA Script to speak the various stick combinations in MultiWii for the FrSky Taranis family of RC radios

This is a script initiallyby Zap Andersson, Crazy Swedish Guy

To use:

1. Put the files to your TARANIS SD card
    - make sure the script go into the SCRIPTS/FUNCTIONS folder
    - make sure the sounds go into the SOUNDS/en folder
2. On the radio, add a custom function who's condition is "ON" (always enabled)
3. Set the function to run LUAScript
4. Pick the "mwiimod.lua" SCRIPT
5. DONE! 


Your Taranis will now speak when you arm, disarm, calibraty gyro/acc/magnetometer or choose profiles.

The script can be modded to understand other stick combinations and say different stuff - read the script itself for docs
